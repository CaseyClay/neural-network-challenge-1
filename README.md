# neural-network-challenge-1  
## Background  
This project is for a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. The goal is to create a model to predict student loan repayment using machine learning and neural networks. The provided CSV file contains information about previous student loan recipients, such as their credit ranking.

## Overview
This challenge involves using deep learning to predict outcomes related to student loans. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb`) where the neural network model is built and trained.

## Challenge Objectives
- To build a neural network model that can accurately predict certain aspects of student loans.
- To understand the influence of various factors on student loan outcomes.
- To fine-tune the model for better performance and accuracy.
